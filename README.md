# MovieLens-Dataset-
MovieLens DataSet ( https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)  is one of the most common datasets for building a Movie Recommender System.

In this project, I have used MovieLens 1M Dataset for building a Movie Recommender System.
These files contain 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000.
